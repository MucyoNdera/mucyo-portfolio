              My name is Mucyo Ndera Tuyizere.
              I am currently a Climate Adaptation Fellow at GanzAfrica Organization,
              where I help design and implement community-driven,
              nature-based solutions using data-driven approaches to strengthen local climate adaptation efforts.
              Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Rwandaâ€™s Centre for Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing,
              contributing to projects that apply geospatial technologies for environmental planning, monitoring, and management.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
              I hold a Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree in Geography with a specialization in Environmental Planning from the University of Rwanda.
              My work is driven by a deep commitment to sustainable environmental practices, with a strong focus on natural resource management, 
              sustainable agriculture, climate adaptation, ecosystem restoration, and community empowerment.
